# A-game-of-chance.c
The program uses pseudo-random number generator functions to provide the element of chance. It has three different game functions, which are called using a single global function pointer, and it uses structs to hold data for the player, which is saved in a file. Multi-user file permissions and user IDs allow multiple users to play and maintain their own account data. The game_of_chance.c program code is heavily documented, and you should be able to understand it at this point
Play around with this program a little bit. The Find the Ace game is a
demonstration of a principle of conditional probability; although it is counterintuitive, changing your pick will increase your chances of finding the ace
from 33 percent to 50 percent. Many people have difficulty understanding
this truth—that’s why it’s counterintuitive. The secret of hacking is understanding little-known truths like this and using them to produce seemingly
magical results.
